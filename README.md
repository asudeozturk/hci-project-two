I believe my primary strengths in relation to this class are creating semantic HTML and responsive CSS.
I also have a good grasp of programming and while I am fairly new to JavaScript I can pick up new concepts quickly.
Finally, I really enjoy the more artistic aspects of web design and I have been learning a lot about CSS grid and flexbox!

I think my primary strengths are being detail-oriented and paying attention to good user experience. I like to think through how users will perform tasks and I try to write clean code that will handle various use cases.
