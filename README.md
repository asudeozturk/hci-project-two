# Andrei Neacsu
I believe my primary strengths in relation to this class are creating semantic HTML and responsive CSS.
I also have a good grasp of programming and while I am fairly new to JavaScript I can pick up new concepts quickly.
Finally, I really enjoy the more artistic aspects of web design and I have been learning a lot about CSS grid and flexbox!

I think my primary strengths are being detail-oriented and paying attention to good user experience. I like to think through how users will perform tasks and I try to write clean code that will handle various use cases. 

# Tyree Spears
I am familiar with web development but the majority of my strengths are in back-end development.
I have a few years worth of experience with a variety of programming languages - JavaScript being one of them.
I enjoy programming behaviour and functionality. Handling front-end visuals is a bit tedious to me.

I think my primary strengths in is front end developement, using HTML and artistic aspects of designing a website. 
I have a good understanding of programming although CSS and JavaScript are relatively new to me, but I can pick up concepts quite easily.
